### Me

Hi - my name is Kersten, I'm a scientist turned data engineer/data scientist from Germany. During my PhD I used satellite data to map rice fields and estimate their production and now I work with aerial imagery and neural networks to create HD maps for self-driving cars. Apart from technology, (open) data sciences and geography I'm passionate about anything on two wheels, own n+1 bicycles, 2 motorbikes, like to cook, enjoy good food, and spoil my dog.
