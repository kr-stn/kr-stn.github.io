title: Tutorial - Visualize Copernicus Hub Metadata 
---
The [Copernicus Sentinel satellites](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Overview4) are an amazing opportunity for everyone to use satellite data at unprecendented spacial and temporal resolution. One of the five Sentinel satellites in orbit is covering any given location in Europe every day. The [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu) is the only source where everyone can access these rapidly growing archives. **This is the second post in a series of tutorials showing you how to search, download, visualize and filter Copernicus sentinel satellite images and metadata using the Python package `sentinelsat`.**

The fast growing archives are presenting us with the unique problem that we now have too much freely available satellite data. The question is not anymore *if* there is enough satellite data but *how* to find the data you need in a multi-petabyte database?

The other tutorials can be found here:

- [01 search and download](redo old tutorial)
- [02 visualize metadata](this one)
- [03 filtering and sorting](based on sentinelsat docu)

The topic on this tutorial is: **What metadata can you query with `sentinelsat` and how to visualize it.**
